    "\n",
    "Not all wrong answers are equally wrong. As the training progresses, _most negative examples $a^-$ will be to easy._ So easy in fact, that loss function and gradients on such negatives is exactly __0.0__. To improve training efficiency, one can __mine hard negative samples__.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to implement at least __hard negative__ sampling and apply it for model training.\n",

    "### 2. Bring Your Own Model (3+ pts)\n",
    "In addition to Universal Sentence Encoder, one can also train a new model.\n",
    "* You name it: convolutions, RNN, self-attention\n",
    "* Use pre-trained ELMO or FastText embeddings\n",
    "* Monitor overfitting and use dropout / word dropout to improve performance\n",

    "\n",
    "Our basic model only selects answers from 2-5 available sentences in paragraph. You can extend it to search over __the whole dataset__. All sentences in all other paragraphs are viable answers.\n",

    "* You can ask such model a question of your own making - to see which answers it can find among the entire training dataset or even the entire wikipedia.\n",
    "* Searching for top-K neighbors is easier if you use specialized methods: [KD-Tree](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KDTree.html) or [HNSW](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib). \n",
    "* This task is much easier to train if you use hard or semi-hard negatives. You can even find hard negatives for one question from correct answers to other questions in batch - do so in-graph for maximum efficiency. See [1.] for more details.\n"
