#### Generative Models, Expectation-Maximization and Word Alignment Models

Today's lecture will cover simple generative models, maximum likelihood estimation from both complete and incomplete data and latent variable word alignment models.

The Expectation-Maximization algorithm is a general algorithm for estimating models when some variables are not observed. It can be seen as a form of _variational inference_.
