    "## Recommended options\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A) CNN architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "All the tricks you know about dense and convolutional neural networks apply here as well.\n",
    "* Dropout. Nuff said.\n",
    "* Batch Norm. This time it's `L.BatchNormalization`\n",
    "* Parallel convolution layers. The idea is that you apply several nn.Conv1d to the same embeddings and concatenate output channels.\n",
    "* More layers, more neurons, ya know...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B) Play with pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "There's more than one way to perform pooling:\n",
    "* Max over time - our `L.GlobalMaxPool1D`\n",
    "* Average over time (excluding PAD)\n",
    "* Softmax-pooling:\n",
    "$$ out_{i, t} = \\sum_t {h_{i,t} \\cdot {{e ^ {h_{i, t}}} \\over \\sum_\\tau e ^ {h_{j, \\tau}} } }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Attentive pooling\n",
    "$$ out_{i, t} = \\sum_t {h_{i,t} \\cdot Attn(h_t)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    ", where $$ Attn(h_t) = {{e ^ {NN_{attn}(h_t)}} \\over \\sum_\\tau e ^ {NN_{attn}(h_\\tau)}}  $$\n",
    "and $NN_{attn}$ is a dense layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal score is usually achieved by concatenating several different poolings, including several attentive pooling with different $NN_{attn}$ (aka multi-headed attention).\n",
    "\n",
    "The catch is that keras layers do not inlude those toys. You will have to [write your own keras layer](https://keras.io/layers/writing-your-own-keras-layers/). Or use pure tensorflow, it might even be easier :)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C) Fun with words\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not always a good idea to train embeddings from scratch. Here's a few tricks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use a pre-trained embeddings from `gensim.downloader.load`. See last lecture.\n",
    "* Start with pre-trained embeddings, then fine-tune them with gradient descent. You may or may not want to use __`.get_keras_embedding()`__ method for word2vec\n",
    "* Use the same embedding matrix in title and desc vectorizer\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### D) Going recurrent\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already learned that recurrent networks can do cool stuff in sequence modelling. Turns out, they're not useless for classification as well. With some tricks of course..\n",
    "\n",
    "* Like convolutional layers, LSTM should be pooled into a fixed-size vector with some of the poolings.\n",
    "* Since you know all the text in advance, use bidirectional RNN\n",
    "  * Run one LSTM from left to right\n",
    "  * Run another in parallel from right to left \n",
    "  * Concatenate their output sequences along unit axis (dim=-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "* It might be good idea to mix convolutions and recurrent layers differently for title and description\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### E) Optimizing seriously\n",
    "\n",
    "* You don't necessarily need 100 epochs. Use early stopping. If you've never done this before, take a look at [early stopping callback](https://keras.io/callbacks/#earlystopping).\n",
    "  * In short, train until you notice that validation\n",
    "  * Maintain the best-on-validation snapshot via `model.save(file_name)`\n",
    "  * Plotting learning curves is usually a good idea\n",
    "  \n",
    "Good luck! And may the force be with you!"
