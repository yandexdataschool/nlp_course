    "#### Some tips\n",
    "Here there are a few more tips on how to improve training that are a bit trickier to impliment. We strongly suggest that you try them _after_ you've got a good initial model.\n",
    "* __Use pre-trained embeddings__: you can use pre-trained weights from [there](http://ahogrammer.com/2017/01/20/the-list-of-pretrained-word-embeddings/) to kickstart your Embedding layer.\n",
    "  * Embedding layer has a matrix W (layer.W) which contains word embeddings for each word in the dictionary. You can just overwrite them with tf.assign.\n",
    "  * When using pre-trained embeddings, pay attention to the fact that model's dictionary is different from your own.\n",
    "  * You may want to switch trainable=False for embedding layer in first few epochs as in regular fine-tuning.  \n",
    "* __Go beyond SimpleRNN__: there's `keras.layers.LSTM` and `keras.layers.GRU`\n",
    "  * If you want to use a custom recurrent Cell, read [this](https://keras.io/layers/recurrent/#rnn)\n",
    "  * You can also use 1D Convolutions (`keras.layers.Conv1D`). They are often as good as recurrent layers but with less overfitting.\n",
    "* __Stack more layers__: if there is a common motif to this course it's about stacking layers\n",
    "  * You can just add recurrent and 1dconv layers on top of one another and keras will understand it\n",
    "  * Just remember that bigger networks may need more epochs to train\n",
    "* __Regularization__: you can apply dropouts as usual but also in an RNN-specific way\n",
    "  * `keras.layers.Dropout` works inbetween RNN layers\n",
    "  * Recurrent layers also have `recurrent_dropout` parameter\n",
    "* __Gradient clipping__: If your training isn't as stable as you'd like, set `clipnorm` in your optimizer.\n",
    "  * Which is to say, it's a good idea to watch over your loss curve at each minibatch. Try tensorboard callback or something similar.\n",
    "* __Word Dropout__: tl;dr randomly replace words with UNK during training. \n",
    "  * This can also simulate increased amount of unknown words in the test set\n",
    "* __Larger vocabulary__: You can obtain greater performance by expanding your model's input dictionary from 5000 to up to every single word!\n",
    "  * Just make sure your model doesn't overfit due to so many parameters.\n",
    "  * Combined with regularizers or pre-trained word-vectors this could be really good cuz right now our model is blind to >5% of words.  \n",
    "* __More efficient batching__: right now TF spends a lot of time iterating over \"0\"s\n",
    "  * This happens because batch is always padded to the length of a longest sentence\n",
    "  * You can speed things up by pre-generating batches of similar lengths and feeding it with randomly chosen pre-generated batch.\n",
    "  * This technically breaks the i.i.d. assumption, but it works unless you come up with some insane rnn architectures.\n",
